Operators:
operators are symbols which perform an operation on data. There
are many different types of operators in java.
Arithmetic Operators:
These operators help us us perform simple mathematical operations like
Addition  => +
Subtraction  => -
Multiplication  => *
Division =>  /
Modulus => %

Shorthand operators :
They help us perform Mathematical operations but using a little shorter syntax.
add and update the variable += int a=10 a+=20  => 30
subtract and update the variable -= int a=10 a-=20  => -10
Multiply and update the variable *= int a=10 a*=20  => 200
Divide and update the variable /= int a=10 a/=20  => 0
Modulus and update the variable %= int a=10 a%=20  => 200
relational operators
These operators help us compare things.
== checks if two objects are equal
!= checks if two objects are not equal
> Greater than
< Less than
>= Greater than equal
<= Less than equal
Logical Operators:
They help us combine multiple boolean conditions.
! Not
|| OR
&& AND
Increment/Decrement operators
++ this will help us increase the value of a variable by one
-- this will help us decrease the value of a variable by one
Note:
While loop checks the condition first then executes the code. Do while on the
other hand executes the code first and then checks the condition. Sometimes
when we write the logic using do while it becomes easier. There are no other
differences and reasons to use a do while instead of while.
