Type Casting:
    Type casting is converting data from one datatype to another (different) datatype.
    For example we can convert an integer to flot, vice versa.
    There are 2 typed of type casting
    1) Implicit/Auto/widening ( smaller container to bigger container no data loss)
    2) Explicit/Manual/narrowing

    Example
    int number=(int)10.5

    type casting only works with primitive data types. String is non-primitive.

    if statements
    if statements are part of the conditional constructs in java. They help us write
    code that can be executed based on a condition.
    There are many variations of if statements, 1)if 2) if-else 3) else-if
    4) Nested if
    Why we need conditional statements?
        Without the if else statements programs will always generate same output
        no matter what.

    Syntax:
    if(condition){
    something that we want to execute if condition is true.
    }else{
    something that we want to put in if condition is false.}

    Note:
    1)Whenever it is possible to write code with else-if and multiple if conditions
    always go with else-if statements.

    2)with primitive datatypes we can use >< == != etc.
    but with non primitives we have to use the equals method.
